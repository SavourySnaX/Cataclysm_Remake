# Cataclysm_Remake
A remake of the Archimedes game Cataclysm - Built as a way to learn Tilemaps in Unity 2017.2

You can play the game in your browser at : http://savourysnax.github.io/Cataclysm_Remake/index.html

Alternatively you can download a build for Windows 32/64 bit, Mac OSX Universal, Linux Universal in the releases tab.

# Overview

Cataclysm is an action puzzler. 
This remake includes the 40 original levels, plus the 3 levels found on the demo disk, and a crude tutorial level that simply aims to show the mechanics.
The remake is slightly easier than the original, which could be unfair at times.

# Aim

Get the fluid into the "bucket" at the bottom/end of the level. Note the colour of the fluid should match (e.g. blue/green/red).
Any fluid that falls to the ground outside of the bucket or is the wrong colour, will increase the red bar at the bottom left of the screen, when this is full, its game over.
You need to fill the blue bar at the top left of the screen to complete the level, before the red bar fills.

# Controls

Cursor Keys or WASD or dpad on a joystick move around
Space or Z or Fire1 drops a block
Enter or X or Fire2 shoots your weapon (if you have one)
Keys 1-5 (normal - 2*) modify the speed of the game, this is to speed things up when you have a solution you are sure will work.
